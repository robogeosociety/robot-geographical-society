# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

**robot-geographical-society** is a robotic trip planner for human adventure — a modern, computer-driven equivalent of the Royal Geographical Society, focused on helping users discover and reserve campsites across Washington State Parks, USFS, and the National Park Service.

### Core Features (Functional Prototype)
- **Map interface** built on Mapbox GL JS showing campsites currently open for reservation
- **Static JSON dataset** of all campsites with metadata (site count, parameters, links)
- **Static RSS feed** of reservation opening dates for tracked campsites (year-round sites excluded)
- **Rich popups** per campsite: site count, site types (RV/tent/bike-in/parking), ICS calendar links, and links to official pages

## Repository Boundary — CRITICAL

**All source code commits go in this repo (`robot-geographical-society`).** Do NOT commit application code to `~/dev/maps` (github.com/tommyroar/maps).

The `maps` repo is a **deploy target only**. Never commit RGS source directly to maps.

## Tooling

- **Frontend:** `web/` — React + Vite + Mapbox GL JS
  - `npm run dev` — local dev server
  - `npm test -- --run` — run tests (Vitest)
  - `npm run lint` — ESLint
  - `npm run build` — production build
- **Campsite data:** `data/campsites.json` — GeoJSON FeatureCollection

## Development Protocol

See **[ISSUES.md](./ISSUES.md)** for the full issue lifecycle protocol (workspace isolation, verification steps, PR process, and deployment).
